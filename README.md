# Provider/MapStateToProps Lab

## Objectives
Use the react-redux library to connect the store to the react application.  
Utilize the Provider, and connect functions in the process.  Work with mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps.

## Overview

In this application we will be building an application to keep track of our favorite restaurants.  We will keep our react application separated from our redux application by using the provider and the connect functions.  We will not include a reference to the store in any component except for the provider.
