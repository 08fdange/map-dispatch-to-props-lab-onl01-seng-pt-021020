# mapDispatchToProps Lab

## Objectives
Use the react-redux library to connect the store to the react application.  
Utilize the Provider, and connect functions in the process.  Work with  mapDispatchToProps.

## Overview

In this application we will be building an application to keep track of our favorite restaurants.  We will keep our react application separated from our redux application by using the provider and the connect functions.  We will not include a reference to the store in any component except for the provider.  

## Instructions

Use the mapDispatchToProps from the redux library to update the store.  First pass through a reference to the action creator as a prop, then use the redux library to ensure that an action is dispatched when a form is submitted.
