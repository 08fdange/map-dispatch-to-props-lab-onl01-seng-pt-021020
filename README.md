# mapDispatchToProps Lab

## Objectives

Use the __React Redux__ library to connect the store to the __React__ application.  
Utilize the __Provider__ component, and the __connect()__ function in the process. Make sure to also implement __mapDispatchToProps()__.

## Overview

In this application we will be building an application to keep track of our favorite restaurants. We will keep our __React__ application separated from our __Redux__ application by using the __Provider__ component and the __connect()__ function. We will not include a reference to the store in any component except for the __Provider__.  

## Instructions

Use the __mapDispatchToProps()__ from the __Redux__ library to update the store. First pass through a reference to the action creator as a prop, then use the __Redux__ library to ensure that an action is dispatched when a form is submitted.
